Iâ€™m a Geospatial Analyst on active duty for the USAF, working on problems at the intersection of GIS and intelligence threats. Academically, my research interests are  in probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and spatial statistics applied to problems in environmental geoscience. See the projects page for interesting recent work.

I first graduated from Penn State University, where I focused on problems at the interesection of spatial socioeconomic-demography and environmental geography. I have since picked up various other academic study in earth science, environmental science, and mathematics. See my CV for a full education history. During my studies, I remained on active duty and was able to apply my academic learning in GIS and spatial probabilistic problems to national threat intelligence.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and geoarchaeolgy books. I have spent many years overseas where I have been fortunate enough to travel frequently and dabble in languages. See the navigation bar for links to recent projects, publications and teaching materials.
